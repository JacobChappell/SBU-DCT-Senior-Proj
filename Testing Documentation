TESTING DOCUMENTATION
This document will explain how to configure the scripts and file structure
as well as the necessary steps in order to test the functionality of the scripts

SETUP:
1. Download the Duck Creek file structure

2. Adjust the variable named $clientPath in any scripts you will use to match
your file structure. 
example: 
Default
$clientPath = 'C:\Users\ebpag\Desktop\DuckCreek\' + $clientName + '\'+ $clientLOBName

Adjusted
$clientPath = 'C:\(Your path to the Duck Creek folder)\DuckCreek\' + $clientName + '\'+ $clientLOBName

3. Once your file strucutre is in the path variable, you are now ready to move on to running the scripts

RUNNING:
1. When you run the script you will be promped to enter a client name. 
Enter TESTCLIENT into the blank and press ENTER to continue.

2. Next you will be asked for the client LOB(Line of business). Enter
the part number of the script that you are currently running (ex. Part4) 
into the blank and press ENTER to continue.

3. ON PART 4 ONLY you will be prompted to enter a version number. Enter 
10_41_0_0 to get the default results. Changing the version number will adjust
output.
